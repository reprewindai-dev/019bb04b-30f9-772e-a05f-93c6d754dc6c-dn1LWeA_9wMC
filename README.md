- **90+ quality score** mandatory to proceed
- **ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY** - Nothing passes unless 100% tested, verified, and proven working
- **ZERO BUGS** - No exceptions, no "minor" bugs allowed
- **ZERO USER DISSATISFACTION** - Users cannot be dissatisfied, create chaos, or disruption
- **NON-NEGOTIABLE** - This standard is absolute and non-acceptable to skip
- Minor adjustments/improvements approved (but still must be fully tested)
- Permission to pull from "brains and engines" for game-changing features

### iCloud Apps
- All apps must be complete and production-ready
- No incomplete or prototype apps

### Save Location
All completed apps saved to: `C:\Users\antho\Documents\[app-name]\`
