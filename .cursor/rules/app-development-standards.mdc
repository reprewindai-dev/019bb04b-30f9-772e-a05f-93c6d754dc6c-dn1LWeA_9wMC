# App Development Standards

## Core Principles

All apps must be **premium, production-ready, and fully functional**. Quality is paramount. **Minimum quality score: 90/100** required before moving to next app.

## One-Time Completion Rule

- **Complete every app once** - Never create the same version twice
- Each app is completed to perfection before moving to the next
- If improvements needed, enhance existing version, don't recreate

## Design Requirements

- **Premium Quality**: Top-tier, class-leading design
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive, easy-to-use interface
- **Professional Look & Feel**: Polished, modern UI/UX
- **Consistent Design**: Follow established design systems
- **Dopamine-Driven UX**: Visually appealing, triggers positive emotions, delightful interactions
- **Visual Polish**: Pixel-perfect execution, stunning visual appeal

## Functionality Requirements

- **Fully Functional**: Every feature must work completely
- **Optimized Performance**: Smooth, responsive operation
- **Production-Ready**: No bugs, errors, or incomplete features
- **Thoroughly Tested**: Tested across devices and scenarios

## API Integration

- **Cost-Friendly APIs**: Use affordable, efficient APIs
- **Optimized Usage**: Minimize API calls and costs
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for all API calls
- **Backend Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with provided backend

## Duplicate Management

When encountering duplicate apps:
1. **Keep**: The most complete, feature-rich version
2. **Discard**: All other duplicates
3. **Criteria**: Most features, best UX, most polished, fully functional

## Code Quality Standards

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Production-ready code
async function fetchUserData(userId: string) {
  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/users/${userId}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to fetch user data', { userId, error });
    throw new UserFetchError('Unable to retrieve user data', { cause: error });
  }
}

// ❌ BAD - Incomplete, not production-ready
async function fetchUserData(userId: string) {
  const response = await api.get(`/users/${userId}`);
  return response.data; // No error handling
}
```

## Enhancement Authorization

- **Permission granted** to pull from "brains and engines" for:
  - Top-tier features that elevate apps
  - Game-changing ideas and innovations
  - Never-seen-before features
  - Features that make apps industry-leading

## Quality Control Scoring

**Minimum Score: 90/100 Required**

Scoring breakdown:
- Visual Design & Dopamine UX: 25 points
- Functionality & Completeness: 25 points
- Performance & Optimization: 15 points
- User Experience & Usability: 15 points
- Innovation & Game-Changing Features: 10 points
- Code Quality & Architecture: 10 points

See QUALITY_CONTROL.md for detailed scoring criteria.

## Checklist Before Completion

- [ ] All features fully implemented
- [ ] Premium, dopamine-driven design implemented
- [ ] Fully optimized (performance & resources)
- [ ] Backend integrated
- [ ] APIs cost-optimized
- [ ] No duplicates exist
- [ ] Thoroughly tested (zero bugs)
- [ ] Production-ready code quality
- [ ] **Quality score: 90+ achieved**
- [ ] **100% completion verified**
- [ ] Saved to `C:\Users\antho\Documents\[app-name]\`

## Completion Requirements

- **Never move to next app until current app scores 90+**
- **100% completion** required - all tasks at highest quality
- Rigorous executive quality control standards
- Minor adjustments/improvements are approved and encouraged
- Some apps may need nothing or minor tweaks - that's fine

## App Purpose

Every app must do its intended purpose **exceptionally well**. If it doesn't serve its purpose perfectly, it's not ready. Apps must be game-changing, top-tier, and never-seen-before quality.
